Intro to ReactJS
================

React.js is a JavaScript library. It was developed by engineers at Facebook.

Here are just a few of the reasons why people choose to program with React:
- React is fast. Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still feel quick and responsive.
- React is modular. Instead of writing large, dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files.
- React's modularity can be a beautiful solution to JavaScript's maintainability problems.
- React is scalable. Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React performs best.
- React is flexible. You can use React for interesting projects that have nothing to do with making a web app.
- People are still figuring out React's potential. There's room to explore.
- React is popular. While this reason has admittedly little to do with React's quality, the truth is that understanding

props
-----
props is quite possibly the longest and most difficult lesson in all of our React courses. Congratulations on getting this far!

Here are some of the skills that you have learned:
- Passing a prop by giving an attribute to a component instance
- Accessing a passed-in prop via this.props.prop-name
- Displaying a prop
- Using a prop to make decisions about what to display
- Defining an event handler in a component class
- Passing an event handler as a prop
- Receiving a prop event handler and attaching it to an event listener
- Naming event handlers and event handler attributes according to convention
- this.props.children
- getDefaultProps
