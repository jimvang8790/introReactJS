Intro to ReactJS
================

React.js is a JavaScript library. It was developed by engineers at Facebook.

Here are just a few of the reasons why people choose to program with React:
- React is fast. Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still feel quick and responsive.
- React is modular. Instead of writing large, dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files.
- React's modularity can be a beautiful solution to JavaScript's maintainability problems.
- React is scalable. Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React performs best.
- React is flexible. You can use React for interesting projects that have nothing to do with making a web app.
- People are still figuring out React's potential. There's room to explore.
- React is popular. While this reason has admittedly little to do with React's quality, the truth is that understanding

Why learn ReactJS?
------------------

ReactJS presents graceful solutions to some of front-end programming's most persistent issues. It's fast, scalable, flexible, powerful, and has a robust developer community that's rapidly growing. There's never been a better time to learn React.

props
-----
props is quite possibly the longest and most difficult lesson in all of our React courses. Congratulations on getting this far!

Here are some of the skills that you have learned:
- Passing a prop by giving an attribute to a component instance
- Accessing a passed-in prop via this.props.prop-name
- Displaying a prop
- Using a prop to make decisions about what to display
- Defining an event handler in a component class
- Passing an event handler as a prop
- Receiving a prop event handler and attaching it to an event listener
- Naming event handlers and event handler attributes according to convention
- this.props.children
- getDefaultProps

Dynamic information
-------------------
Dynamic information is information that can change.

React components will often need dynamic information in order to render. For example, imagine a component that displays the score of a basketball game. The score of the game might change over time, meaning that the score is dynamic. Our component will have to know the score, a piece of dynamic information, in order to render in a useful way.

There are two ways for a component to get dynamic information: props and state. Besides props and state, every value used in a component should always stay exactly the same.

You just spent a long lesson learning about props. Now it's time to learn about state. props and state are all that you need to set up an ecosystem of interacting React components.

Summary
-------

In this unit, you learned how to use import and export to access one file from another. You learned about props and state, and the countless variations on how they work.

A React app is basically just a lot of components, setting state and passing props to one another. Now that you have a real understanding of how to use props and state
