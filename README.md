Intro to ReactJS
================

React.js is a JavaScript library. It was developed by engineers at Facebook.

Here are just a few of the reasons why people choose to program with React:
- React is fast. Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still feel quick and responsive.
- React is modular. Instead of writing large, dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files.
- React's modularity can be a beautiful solution to JavaScript's maintainability problems.
- React is scalable. Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React performs best.
- React is flexible. You can use React for interesting projects that have nothing to do with making a web app.
- People are still figuring out React's potential. There's room to explore.
- React is popular. While this reason has admittedly little to do with React's quality, the truth is that understanding React will make you more employable.
