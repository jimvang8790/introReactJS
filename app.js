const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
// this is javascript Despite what it looks like, your code doesn't actually contain any HTML at all.
// The part that looks like HTML, <h1>Hello world</h1>, is something called JSX.
// JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML.
// In this case, it means that JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can't read it!
// If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.
